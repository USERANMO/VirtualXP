This is a fork of VIrtualXP made by lrusso. This fork will include some new stuff to the emulator.

What's new:

Increased memory to 512mb of RAM, will probably do 1024 if I change the operating system.


To-do list:
1. Change OS. WIll change from VirtualXP to another Windows XP Live CD iso.
2. Increase memory to 1024MB (1GB in other terms)
